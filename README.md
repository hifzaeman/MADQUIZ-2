**#Description:**
Image Classifier is a mobile application that allows users to sign in, take pictures, select images from the gallery, classify images, and encode images. This project leverages Firebase authentication for user sign-in and Expo for mobile application development.

**#Features:**

_User Authentication:_
Users are required to sign in before accessing the app's functionalities.
Firebase authentication is used for secure user authentication.

_Capture Images:_
Users can take pictures using their device's camera within the app.

_Select Images from Gallery:_
Users have the option to choose images from their device's gallery.

_Image Classification:_
The app provides image classification functionality, allowing users to classify selected images.

_Image Encoding:_
Users can encode images using the app's encoding feature.
Here are some common tasks you can accomplish using a sentence encoder model:

_Semantic Similarity:_ You can compare the similarity between two sentences or paragraphs by encoding them into vectors and then calculating the similarity between these vectors using metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.

_Text Classification:_ Sentence encoders can be used as feature extractors for text classification tasks, where the encoded representations of sentences are fed into a classifier to determine the category or label of the text.

_Information Retrieval:_ In search engines or question answering systems, sentence encoders can help retrieve relevant documents or answers by encoding queries and comparing them with the encoded representations of documents or passages.

_Summarization: _Sentence encoders can be used as part of summarization systems to encode sentences in a document and then select or generate a summary based on the encoded representations.

_Sentiment Analysis:_ By encoding sentences or paragraphs into vectors, you can perform sentiment analysis tasks to determine the sentiment expressed in the text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral

**#Technologies Used:**

_Firebase:_ Firebase is utilized for user authentication.

_Expo:_ Expo is used for mobile application development, providing a seamless development experience and easy deployment to mobile devices.

_React Native:_ The project is built using React Native, enabling cross-platform mobile application development.

**#Installation:**

To run the project, follow these steps:

#Clone the repository:

bash

Copy code

git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the project directory:

**Add Firebase Configuration:**

You need to add your own Firebase configuration to the project to enable authentication. Follow the Firebase documentation for instructions on how to set up Firebase in your project.
Run the project:
sql
Copy code
npm start
Use Expo Go:
It is recommended to run the project on Expo Go mobile app for a seamless experience on your mobile device. Scan the QR code generated by Expo to open the project on Expo Go.

**#Note:**
Ensure that you have Expo Go installed on your mobile device to run the project seamlessly.
This project requires Firebase configuration for authentication to function properly.
